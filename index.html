				<td>On the Philippine island of Mindanao, there is a deep spring river known as the Hinatuan Enchanted River, or the Hinatuan Sacred River. It empties into the Pacific Ocean near Barangay Talisay, Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur, and the Philippine Sea. </td>
				
				<td>One of the most exquisite alleys in the Philippines is Calle Crisologo in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, despite its little length of just 500 meters. It has gorgeous tungsten lighting, ancient cobblestone, and stone homes that date back hundreds of years. Horse-drawn carriages, called kalesas, are still used for transportation there. </td>
				
				<td>The Banaue Rice Terraces are a series of terraces etched by the Igorot people's forefathers into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, Philippines. There are times when people refer to the terraces as the "Eighth Wonder of the World".</td>
